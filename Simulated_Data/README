The simulated Heavy and Light chains in fasta format with different degrees of somatic hypermutations were obtained from immuneSIM (https://immunesim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
The fasta sequences were used as a reference to obtain illumina libraries using ART (https://www.niehs.nih.gov/research/resources/software/biostatistics/art/index.cfm).

The fasta sequences of the simulated datasets with different levels of SHMs in the CDRs of the variable domains of HC and LC can be found in the Supplementary Table S4 of the manuscript.
The fastq files obtained will be uploaded after first round of revision.
