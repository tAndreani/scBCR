# scBCR Benchmarking
Benchmarking computational methods for B cell receptor reconstruction from single cell RNA-seq data. This repository is an extension of [ScBCR](https://gitlab.com/tAndreani/scBCR), a platform with all the methods currently available and ready to be installed and used to reconstruct paired haeavy and light chain in individual B cells.
