In this folder I have uploaded the scripts to calculate the sensitivity for HC and LC(K/L). You can find the input files that are used to run the scripts.
These files are:
1) HC ground truth annotated using immcantation;
2) LC(K/L) ground truth annotated using immcantation;
3) Output from the reconstruction of HC and LC(K/L) from one tool named BALDR;

The script can be adapted from other tools.
