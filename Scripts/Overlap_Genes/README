To corroborate the performance of each method using the sensitivity as a metric an overlap of the genes among the tools during the BCR reconstruction has been performend. 
In Supplementary_Table6 it is possible to find all the genes overlapped. Here I upload the matrices to make the triangular heatmap using the script in the folder.
